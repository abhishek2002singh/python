# 🚀 Learning Python

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! 🐍  
This repository contains my notes, practice code, and examples as I explore Python step by step.

## 📚 Topics I'm Learning

- **Data Types**  
  ➝ Understanding `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `NoneType`, etc.

- **Variables**  
  ➝ Different types of variables and naming conventions.

- **Tuples**  
  ➝ Properties (immutable) and all tuple methods.

- **Lists**  
  ➝ Properties (mutable), list operations, and all list methods.

- **Dictionaries**  
  ➝ Key-value pairs, dictionary methods, and use cases.

- **Slicing & Indexing**  
  ➝ Accessing sequences efficiently.

- **Operators**  
  ➝ Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, membership, and identity operators.

- **Classes & `type()`**  
  ➝ Why we use classes and how to check the type of objects.
