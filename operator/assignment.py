# assignment operators - assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

# = - assigns value from right side to left side
# += - adds right side value to left side value and assigns to left side
# -= - subtracts right side value from left side value and assigns to left side
# *= - multiplies right side value with left side value and assigns to left side
# /= - divides left side value by right side value and assigns to left side
# //= - performs floor division on left side value by right side value and assigns to left
# %= - performs modulus on left side value by right side value and assigns to left side
# **= - performs exponentiation on left side value by right side value and assigns to left


a = 10  # assigns value 10 to variable a
print(a)
a += 5  # adds 5 to a and assigns to a (a = a + 5)
print(a)
a -= 3  # subtracts 3 from a and assigns to a (a = a - 3)
print(a)    
a *= 2  # multiplies a by 2 and assigns to a (a = a * 2)
print(a)
a /= 4  # divides a by 4 and assigns to a (a = a / 4)
print(a)
a //= 2  # performs floor division of a by 2 and assigns to a (a = a // 2)
print(a)
a %= 3  # performs modulus of a by 3 and assigns to a (a = a % 3)
print(a)
a **= 4  # performs exponentiation of a by 4 and assigns to a (a = a ** 4)
print(a)
